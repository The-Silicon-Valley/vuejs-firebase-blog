## Frontend for Blog
For front end use [this](https://www.taniarascia.com/) reference. A very simple one and easy to implement.

## Admin UI
We are not using any admin template, front end devs will assist in this.
We will keep the overall layout like that of WordPress.
Just plain old Title, Body, Categories and Featured image.
Other fancy things can be added as an when needed.


## Contribution Guide
We are starting this in month of October to support [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) and encourage new developers to contribute openly. We are totally open to any kind of contribution, even improving this readme file. 
Just try to keep it in a good shape and learn good code
